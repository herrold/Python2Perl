Python2Perl
------------
Python2Perl is a translator between Python 2.4 [1] and Perl 5 [2]. The goal
of the translator is to provide a reasonable translation between a subset
of the languages.

It is mandatory to read the design documentation in doc/DESIGN.md where I
fully explain my approach and how the system works. This will take a lot
of the ambiguity out of my solution and make it easier to see how my
approach differs from what most students attempted.
